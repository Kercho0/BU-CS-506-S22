Midterm:
The midterm for this course was a Kaggle competition where students competed to create the best possible prediction model. The model was trained on Amazon movie reviews, and was supposed to predict the rating out of five stars that a review had based on the review text and other characteristics. My model was able to produce the highest validation score in the class, earning first place in the competition. My overall grade was 98/100, where two points were lost on the report.
