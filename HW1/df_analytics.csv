It has many small datasets to guide students to work out pencil solutions of the models and then compare with results obtained from established R packages. Also, as data science practice is a process that should be told as a story, in this book there are many course materials about exploratory data analysis, residual analysis, and flowcharts to develop and validate models and data pipelines. The main models covered in this book include linear regression, logistic regression, tree models and random forests, ensemble learning, sparse learning, principal component analysis, kernel methods including the support vector machine and kernel regression, and deep learning. Each chapter introduces two or three techniques. For each technique, the book highlights the intuition and rationale first, then shows how mathematics is used to articulate the intuition and formulate the learning problem. R is used to implement the techniques on both simulated and real-world dataset.

The bandwagon keeps answering, absolutely everything! Analytics and artificial intelligence have captured the attention of everyone from top executives to the person in the street. While these disciplines have a relatively long history, within the last ten or so years they have exploded into corporate business and public consciousness. Organizations have rushed to embrace data-driven decision making. Companies everywhere are turning out products boasting that ""artificial intelligence is included."" We are indeed living in exciting times. The question we need to ask is, do we really know how to get business value from these exciting tools? Unfortunately, both the analytics and AI communities have not done a great job in collaborating and communicating with each other to build the necessary synergies. This book bridges the gap between these two critical fields. The book begins by explaining the commonalities and differences in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and autonomy by giving a historical perspective for each of these fields, followed by exploration of common technologies and current trends in each field. The book also readers introduces to applications of deep learning in industry with an overview of deep learning and its key architectures, as well as a survey and discussion of the main applications of deep learning. The book also presents case studies to illustrate applications of AI and analytics. These include a case study from the healthcare industry and an investigation of a digital transformation enabled by AI and analytics transforming a product-oriented company into one delivering solutions and services.

Anyone playing a role in the field of analytics can benefit from this book as well. In the two decades the editors of this book spent teaching and consulting in the field of analytics, they noticed a critical shortcoming in the communication abilities of many analytics professionals. Specifically, analysts have difficulty in articulating in business terms what their analyses showed and what actionable recommendations were made. When analysts made presentations, they tended to lapse into the technicalities of mathematical procedures, rather than focusing on the strategic and tactical impact and meaning of their work. As analytics has become more mainstream and widespread in organizations, this problem has grown more acute. Data Analytics: Effective Methods for Presenting Results tackles this issue. The editors have used their experience as presenters and audience members who have become lost during presentation. Over the years, they experimented with different ways of presenting analytics work to make a more compelling case to top managers. They have discovered tried and true methods for improving presentations, which they share. The book also presents insights from other analysts and managers who share their own experiences. It is truly a collection of experiences and insight from academics and professionals involved with analytics. The book is not a primer on how to draw the most beautiful charts and graphs or about how to perform any specific kind of analysis. Rather, it shares the experiences of professionals in various industries about how they present their analytics results effectively. They tell their stories on how to win over audiences. The book spans multiple functional areas within a business, and in some cases, it discusses how to adapt presentations to the needs of audiences at different levels of management.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781351973410'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '135197341X'}]",False,True,158,BOOK,['Computers'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Data+analytics&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Data_Analytics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QuiIDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"If you are a manager who receives the results of any data analyst’s work to help with your decision-making, this book is for you.

Kelleher', 'Brian Mac Namee', ""Aoife D'Arcy""]",MIT Press,2020-10-20,"The second edition of a comprehensive introduction to machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theory and practice. Machine learning is often used to build predictive models by extracting patterns from large datasets. These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context. This second edition covers recent developments in machine learning, especially in a new chapter on deep learning, and two new chapters that go beyond predictive analytics to cover unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The book is accessible, offering nontechnical explanations of the ideas underpinning each approach before introducing mathematical models and algorithms. It is focused and deep, providing students with detailed knowledge on core concepts, giving them a solid basis for exploring the field on their own. Both early chapters and later case studies illustrate how the process of learning predictive models fits into the broader business context. The two case studies describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book can be used as a textbook at the introductory level or as a reference for professionals.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262044691'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262044692'}]",False,True,856,BOOK,['Computers'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Data+analytics&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+analytics&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Machine_Learning_for_Pre.html?hl=&id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1Iv-DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This second edition covers recent developments in machine learning, especially in a new chapter on deep learning, and two new chapters that go beyond predictive analytics to cover unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.",5.0,1.0,,,,,,
