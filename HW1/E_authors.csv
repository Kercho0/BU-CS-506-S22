Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition—as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications. Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of “data science,” and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262529518'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262529513'}]",False,True,230.0,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.1.0.preview.1,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+learning&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.",The New AI,False,False,,,,,,,Machine Learning,,,['Ethem Alpaydin']

This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python. The book can be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses; practitioners will find it an essential reference.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262039512'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262039516'}]",False,True,192.0,BOOK,['Computers'],4.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Deep_Learning.html?hl=&id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LrT4DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,The book can be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses; practitioners will find it an essential reference.,,False,False,,,,,,,Deep Learning,,,['Eugene Charniak']
